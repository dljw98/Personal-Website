# Personal Website - Passion Project

## Introduction
This project is simply a personal website I created as a passion project. I have always been interested in web design, so it only seemed natural for me to integrate aspects of my data science knowledge into a website of my own creation.

## Website Details
This website was created with HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I have also used PyScript for some of the website sections to leverage modules such as numpy and BeautifulSoup for Web Scraping. I have also documented a few snippets of Machine Learning knowledge that I have accumulated during my time studying as a Data Analyst and Scientist in NUS, such as the fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks, NLPs, XGBoost and Support Vector Machines, and Model Tuning (in Python code). I have included some of my project highlights in my website as well, which will direct users to the respective GitHub repositories of each project. I have also provided my notes on Data Structures and Algorithms (in Java code) in the webstie under the Data Science section, as well as some brief guides on MySQL.

## Concluding Thoughts
This website is constantly being worked out in my spare time and I hope to continue to add new features over time.
